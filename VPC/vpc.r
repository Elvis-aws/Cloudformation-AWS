VPC
    Definition
        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud enables you to lunch Amazon Web Services 9AWS) resources into a virtual network that
        that you have defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you would operate in your 
        own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
    Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud where you can 
    launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking 
    environment, including selection of your own IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route 
    tables and network gateways. You can also create a hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your 
    corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter. You 
    can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon VPC. For example, you can create a public-facing 
    subnet for your web servers that have access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases or 
    application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security, 
    including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each 
    subnet.

Traffic Mirroring
    Copy network traffic from network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances for deep packet 
    inspection.
Transit gateways
    Use a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub, to route traffic between your VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS 
    Direct Connect connections.
VPC Flow Logs
    A flow log captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
