Security Group
    A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated 
    with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and 
    outbound traffic for the instance.
    You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
    When you first create a security group, it has no inbound rules. Therefore, no inbound traffic is allowed until 
    you add inbound rules to the security group.
    When you first create a security group, it has an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic from the resource. 
    You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that allow specific outbound traffic only. If your security group 
    has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic is allowed.
    When you associate multiple security groups with a resource, the rules from each security group are aggregated 
    to form a single set of rules that are used to determine whether to allow access.
    When you add, update, or remove rules, your changes are automatically applied to all resources associated with 
    the security group. The effect of some rule changes can depend on how the traffic is tracked.
    are Stateful â€“ responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow outbound regardless of outbound rules, 
    and vice versa. Hence an Outbound rule for the response is not needed
