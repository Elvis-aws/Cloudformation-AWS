General Purpose
****************
    - General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used 
      for a variety of diverse workloads. These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources 
      in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories. T,M

Compute Optimized
****************
    - Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance 
     processors. Instances belonging to this family are well suited for batch processing workloads, media 
     transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated 
     gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning inference and other compute intensive applications.

Memory Optimized
****************
    - Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data 
    sets in memory. R

Accelerated Computing
*********************
    - Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such 
    as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than 
    is possible in software running on CPUs. P

Storage Optimized
******************
    - Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access 
    to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random 
    I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications. I
